A precision agriculture robot which can provide growth health information during the entire growth cycle of crops, such as disease and insect pest detection, water and nitrogen content detection, maturity prediction, yield prediction, farm 3D mapping, etc.

Here, we provide a slide and a video to introduce our robot in detail, as well as related model diagrams and codes.
